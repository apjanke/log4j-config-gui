log4j1-config-gui Developer's Guide
==================================

The public interface for `log4j1-config-gui` is in the `net.apjanke.log4j1gui` package.

The `net.apjanke.log4j1gui.internal` package contains implementation classes for `log4j1-config-gui`'s internal use. Client code should not reference or call these directly. This package is largely uncommented, because I think it's all pretty straightforward Swing code.
