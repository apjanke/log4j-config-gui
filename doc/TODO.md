TODO for log4j1-config-gui
=============================

* Add Cmd-W for close; other hotkey support
* Validation and error handling for numeric-valued text fields
* Extensible menu options for appender editors
 * To support those with "activateOptions()" or other methods that aren't property setters
* When resizing the Logger editor window, the Appenders widget should expand to fill horizontally, and the controls panel should stay left-aligned.
* The JTextFields and JLabels in controls for ThingEditor widgets are slightly misaligned (on macOS); the JLabels show up a few pixels left of where the JTextFields and JCheckBoxes start.
* Right-click in the empty space of a Filters or Appenders list should still bring up a context menu.
* Editor text fields for loggers and appenders should expand horizontally with window resize, to accomodate large fields for file names.
* Log4j 2.x support
